# Download

You probably don't want to develop this font yourself. Just [click here](https://github.com/pennomi/swords-font/raw/master/SwordsII.ttf) to download the `.ttf` file now!

# Legacy Font

The `Swords.ttf` file is an older version of the font, which was made before we knew how to do things better. The new font `SwordsII.ttf` is different enough that it breaks backwards compatibility, so we decided to create a new version altogether.

# Contributing

To add more glyphs or submit fixes to the font, you'll need [FontForge](https://fontforge.github.io).

Once you have that installed, fork the repository, clone it, and open up `SwordsII.sfd`.

You can adjust individual glyphs or add some new ones! FontForge is pretty crazy sometimes, but there's decent documentation online for the adventurous.

Once you've made changes, send a pull request into GitHub, and we'll review the merge.

# Easter Eggs

Try using the Dagger glyph (†), the Crossed Swords glyph (⚔), and the Generic Currency glyph (¤).
