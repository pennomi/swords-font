# Download

You probably don't want to develop this font yourself. Just [click here]() to download the `.ttf` file now!

# Contributing

To add more glyphs or submit fixes to the font, you'll need [FontForge](https://fontforge.github.io).

Once you have that installed, fork the repository, clone it, and open up `Swords.sfd`.

You can adjust individual glyphs or add some new ones! FontForge is pretty crazy sometimes, but there's decent documentation online for the adventurous.

Once you've made changes, send a pull request into GitHub and we'll review the merge.
